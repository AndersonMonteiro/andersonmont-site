  Hello! I'm Anderson, a Software Engineer with a robust background in fintech solutions and DevOps technologies. With over 10 years of experience in the tech industry, I specialize in crafting efficient, scalable, and innovative software solutions. My journey in the tech world has been driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a deep commitment to excellence. Whether it's developing complex backend systems in Go and Python or orchestrating cloud services with AWS and Kubernetes, I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of technology.

  Recently, I embarked on a research project that explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Education, focusing on its application in personal financial management. This project integrates AI and NLP to enhance financial literacy, aiding individuals in making smarter and more automated financial decisions. It utilizes technologies such as Python, Go, OpenAI GPT-4, AWS, and others, showcasing my commitment to integrating cutting-edge technologies into practical solutions.
